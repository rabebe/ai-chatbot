The Self-Correcting Summarization Agent represents a significant advancement in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-quality content generation. The core of this system is an iterative workflow managed by LangGraph, which moves beyond simple, one-shot LLM calls. This architecture ensures that the final output is not just generated, but rigorously evaluated and refined until it meets a high standard of quality. The process begins with ingestion, where a long document is broken down into smaller, semantically coherent chunks to fit within the LLM's context window.

Once chunked, the initial summary draft is created using the first few pieces of context. The draft then immediately enters the quality control loop. This loop is governed by the Judge Node—an independent LLM—which assesses the draft against a predetermined rubric covering criteria such as accuracy, clarity, and conciseness. If the Judge identifies any flaws, it generates a structured critique and sends a 'FAIL' signal. This feedback is crucial for the subsequent step.

The Refinement Node receives both the flawed summary and the Judge's specific critique. It uses this information to intelligently revise the summary, aiming to correct the exact issues raised by the critic. This refined version is then looped back to the Judge for re-evaluation. The loop continues until the Judge returns a 'PASS' signal, indicating the summary is satisfactory, or until the configured maximum number of refinement steps (typically three) is reached. This iterative, self-correcting mechanism ensures robust and reliable results, minimizing the human oversight required for quality assurance.
